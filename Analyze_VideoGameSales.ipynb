    "Video games are something that I have been interested in since I was very young. As the industry continues to grow in popularity, it is interesting to look at the sales of specific games to see where the popularity truly lies. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we are going to analyze this dataset tracking the sales of each individual video game title with over 100k sales up to the year 2016. The dataset was downloaded on Kaggle and the data was scraped from the website vgchartz.com, a website that collects data for everything related to video game sales.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using this data, we are going to answer some interesting questions such as:<br>\n",
    "> * Which publisher has sold the most titles during each decade? (80s, 90s, 2000s)<br>\n",
    "> * Which platform had the highest selling sales during its lifespan?<br>\n",
    "> * Which genre has sold the most titles overall?<br>\n",

    "The data was imported into the SQL database videogamesales from a txt file and resides in the table videogamesales (see videogamesales.sql). The txt file was created after I used Pandas to clean and format the data from the original CSV file. This first line of code connects us to the database. Let's SELECT all of the columns from the videogamesales table and limit the output to the first ten columns to keep it clean."

    "As we can see the output, the top 10 titles sold up to 2016 were all published by the Japanese company Nintendo. This makes a lot of sense due to Nintendo priding themselves as a company who makes games for targeted to every demographic and for being trailblazers in regard to hardware innovation. These reasons garnered them massive success outside of Japan, explaining why they fill each top 10 spot. Something I found particularly interesting is that Duck Hunt, a shooter title, is solely on the 10th spot due to its NA sales as its sales outside of that region are mediocre. This was due to Duck Hunt being a game that required a gun-looking controller which definitely had an appeal in a countries such as the United States or Canada where hunting is a popular hobby.\n",

They also have the 2nd highest total titles behind Namco Bandai Games and 2nd highest average title sales behind Bethesda Softworks. Ironically, Namco Bandai has the lowest average title sales within the top 20 and Bethesda has the lowest total titles within the top 20. \n",

It is interesting to see that the data reflects these perceptions of these respective publishers."
