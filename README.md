# SQL-Portfolio-Project--VideoGameSales

Thank you for checking out my project! Video games are something that I have been interested in for a long time and I wanted to see if certain trends I knew about
the gaming industry prior could be confirmed through data analytics. I used a dataset I found on Kaggle that scarped video game sale data from the website vgchartz.com.
This dataset is the vgsales.csv file in the repository.

## Preparation:
I used Python's Numpy & Pandas libraries to clean, prepare, and import the dataset into MySQL. I deceided on this method because I was having difficulty importing the data from
the CSV file into the SQL table I created. I used a method of creating a list of tuples that was formatted properly, exporting as a txt file, and adding the contents of the
txt file into the SQL table manually. Please refer to Data Import & Export.inuyp, VideoGameSales.sql, and vgsales.txt to see how this was done.

I then used MySQL through Python to create my queries for further analysis. Please refer to Analyze_VideoGameSales.inuyp where I provided my code, queries, and written analysis of 
each query into sections.
